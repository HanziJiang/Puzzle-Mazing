Hello Professors and TAs,

This project has several dependencies, which can be found, as the industry
standard stands, in the build.gradle file. Android Studio should automatically
build and install all the dependencies for you during build time. If not,
use the menu Build -> Rebuild Project.

Special Notes
If you have no prior experience with Flux, you may find this project
overwhelmingly confusing. We encourage you to read the details about Flux
in our documentation: https://v2.puzzlemazing.online.
